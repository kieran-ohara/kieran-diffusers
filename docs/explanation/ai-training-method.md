To try and maintain some sort of control over the experiment, I want to lock the images to be the same so that the only variables changing are controlled by me. To do this I settled on a standard bunch of prompts and locked the seed to ensure I was only seeing the difference in LR/Steps.

| variable           | value    |
| ------------------ | -------- |
| instance_daata_dir | kieran2  |
| instance prompt    | kokieran |
| class_prompt       | man      |
| num_class_images   | 200      |
| learning_rate      | 5e-6     |
